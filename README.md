# Particle Playground – My First Google Antigravity Web App

This is the **first ever web app** I’ve created using **Google Antigravity**.  
It took about **5 minutes** from idea to running app, mainly as a test to see how the tool works and what kind of code it generates.

The result is a simple but fun **mouse-interactive particle playground** that runs entirely in the browser.

## 💡 What the App Does

- Shows a fullscreen canvas with glowing particles  
- Particles move and react to your mouse position  
- Creates smooth, relaxing visual effects in real time  
- Built with **HTML + CSS + JavaScript (Canvas)**

It’s not meant to be a serious product – just an experiment, a proof of concept, and a memory of my **first AI-assisted web app build**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. Move your mouse around the screen and watch the particles react.

No build step, no dependencies, no backend – just open and play.

## 🧪 Why This Exists

- To test **Google Antigravity** and see how it handles a full small project.
- To have a minimal example of an **AI-generated frontend app**.
- To mark the moment I created my **first web app** with these tools.

## 🔮 Next Ideas

- Add UI controls to tweak number of particles, colors, and effects  
- Add a “gravity / antigravity” toggle  
- Add mobile / touch support
